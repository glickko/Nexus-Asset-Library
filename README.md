2.  **Browse and Select:** Your media will appear in the library panel. Double-click any file to load it into the previewer.
3.  **Trim Your Asset:** Use the playback controls and the professional trim slider to define the exact portion of the media you want to clip. Click `Apply Trim and Cache`.
4.  **Use Your Cached Clip:** Your new, trimmed clip will appear in the "Processed Cache" panel on the right. You can now drag and drop it directly from the application into your video editor or any other folder.

### Where Your Files Are Stored

All your trimmed clips, thumbnails, and the application's log file are stored securely and automatically in a dedicated folder within your user's Documents directory:
